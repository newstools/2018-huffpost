Greetings, Potheads. The past six months have been prime Instant Pot season, as the colder weather and holiday vibes provided the perfect environment for the chilis and stews that the Instant Pot so gloriously executes. But enough is enough. We absolutely cannot eat one more chili or stew. We crave foods that are fresh and bright, so it’s time to break free from this hot, salty prison we’ve created for ourselves. Thankfully, the Instant Pot has been around for a few seasons now, and recipe developers and food bloggers are finally starting to crank out recipes that go beyond winter fare. We’re sharing 29 of our favorites, from pressure-cooked artichokes to deviled eggs and even potato salad. Start the transition now, before it’s too late.
